Hey! This is literally just the source code and music for my lightshow, if you'd like to see it yourself here's some information that should be useful:
Illuminations download and extra info: https://illuminations.mit.edu/

If you're trying to load it yourself, here's a few things to note:
1. Make sure you update the song file location with wherever it is on your device
2. Make sure you add all of the controls from the controls screenshot, otherwise it won't work
3. To play it from the beginning set BPM Multiplier to 1 and startingBeat to 1

That's it, feel free to push an issue if you notice anything wrong with the files themselves
